    "# Text Analysis with Azure Cognitive Services Text Analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This explains the basics of writing a custom Cognitive Services Text Analytics application for analyzing long, open-form text. \n",
    "Specifically, we'll get key phrases and common entities (e.g. organizations) from each text input. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**For the code to function properly, we will need the below two things:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Text Analytics key, and\n",
    "2. Text Analytics endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to keep these Azure credentials secure: we have to keep them private and secure! \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting started\n",
    "Read through the section below to learn more about Text Analytics. Then run the code block below to import and process the sample text files stored in the *TextFiles* folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "To process your own text, replace the sample text files in the *TextFiles* folder with your own .txt files."

    "## More information on Text Data\n",
    "This notebook takes a set of text stored in the **TextFiles** folder. These input text files can be different lengths, but distinct sentences or paragraphs should be separated by a new line.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may run this notebook on the sample text provided, which include text copied from Wikipedia articles. Each text file contains content from a single Wikipedia article, with the file name indicating the name of the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you may upload your own text files into the **TextFiles** folder. How you organize the text into different files will depend on your particular needs. Here is an example scenario for handling open-form survey responses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Copy and paste all responses to a single question into a unique text file. \n",
    "    * Copying and pasting from Excel rows works great, as it will include a newline between each unique response.\n",
    "2. Save each text file in a subfolder called \"TextFiles\" (or update the filepath in the code block below where it says \"To Do\").\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible issues and how to fix it**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run into any issues as you run the code blocks, here are some troubleshooting tips that might be helpful:\n",
    "* The Cognitive Services Text Analytics Python SDK V3 requires the following input formats:\n",
    "    * Raw Text Input\n",
    "    * Encoding: UTF-8 or UTF-16\n",
    "    * Document size less than 5,120 characters (this is handled in the import data section)\n",
    "    * Some methods (e.g. entity recognition) require a batch size of 5 or less.\n",
    "    * Input text should be in one of the following formats:\n",
    "        * a list of strings: \n",
    "        \n",
    "            ```list[str]```\n",
    "        * a list of text documents: \n",
    "        \n",
    "            ```list[TextDocumentInput]```\n",
    "        * or a list of dictionary representations with at least two string elements, ID and text:\n",
    "\n",
    "             ```list[dict[str, str]]``` \n",
    "             \n",
    "             E.g. ```texts = [{'id': Unique_Id1, 'text': Input_Text1}, {'id': Unique_ID2, 'text': Input_Text2}, ...]```\n",
    "    * If you wish to specify the ID and language on a per-item basis you must use as input a list of text documents or a list of dict representations. \n",
    "    * [More info on data limits here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/overview#data-limits)\n",
    "* An \"HttpOperationErrText\", \"HttpResponseError\" or similar error indicates that the Text Analytics method did not get a correctly formatted input. Some things to check:\n",
    "    * Batch size limits.\n",
    "    * Iterating through multiple text files such that the method inputs fit one of the three options above.\n",
    "    * Any list of dictionary inputs contains unique ids for each dictionary. \n",
    "* A \"list index out of range\" error indicates that the input text is too long for the Text Analytics client to handle.\n",
    "* Run into other issues? Please let us know by opening an issue on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jenfoxbot/text-analytics-walkthrough)."
